<h2>Jakarta - Home of Indonesia</h2>
<p>Jakarta is the capital (still, right?) of Indonesia and a dynamic city rich in history, culture, and culinary diversity. It’s a vibrant metropolis where all traditions blend seamlessly with modern urban life. The city offers a rich cultural blend from all over the Nusantara—making it a true reflection of Indonesia in one place.</p>

<p>From historical heritage left by the colonies, like the charming streets of Kota Tua, to the fast-paced, slightly ‘Western’-inspired lifestyle in places like Blok M and SCBD, Jakarta is full of contrasts that somehow work together.</p>

<p>This city has everything: the culture, the food, the people, and the energy. Whether you're exploring traditional markets, enjoying world-class cuisine, or watching the sun set behind the skyline, Jakarta always has something to offer. It’s a city you don’t just visit—you feel it, live it, and carry it with you.</p>

<p>With the way all the cultures blend, it kinda makes me wonder. Should I name the title "Jakarta - Home of Indonesia" or change it to "Jakarta - Home of Everything"?</p>
