<h2>About Me</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> Joaquin Fairuz Nawfal Ismono</li>
  <li><strong>Brief Description About Myself:</strong> I'm an Informatics Engineering student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, currently on my 3rd semester. I love swimming, but I hate to clean my body up post-swimming. Maybe that's why I don't really swim often. I was born and raised in Jakarta, so yes, I move all the way from there to Surabaya just to study. But I'll definitely go back to Jakarta (soon, I hope).</li>
